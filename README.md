# AngularFlashCardsForLanguageLearning

## Description
The FOSS app I was using to manage my flash cards was great, but locked to the platform I was using. I whipped this up over a weekend to use instead from any platform, and kept it easy to update when needed. You can see it in action here: [https://flashcards.devlay.com](https://flashcards.devlay.com)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
